abstract: >
  Student housing rents are a large component of university costs and high rents contribute to student housing insecurity. Using data covering U.S. student housing markets from the 2014â€“2022, this paper studies changes in student rents and investigates why they vary by location and university. Private-market student housing costs increased by 15% more than national inflation during this period and closely tracked local rents for general-purpose housing, suggesting close integration with the rest of the housing market. In contrast, on-campus rents increased by only 7% and showed little correlation with local rents in the broader housing market. Enrollment increases raised the cost of on-campus but not off-campus housing. We show that universities insulate students from local housing market pressures, effectively providing implicit housing subsidies, particularly in urban areas and at top-ranked institutions.
